# go-yara

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/hillu/go-yara?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/hillu/go-yara)

Go bindings for [YARA](http://plusvic.github.io/yara/), staying as
close as sensible to the library's API while taking inspiration from
the `yara-python` implementation.

The API is still somewhat in flux, so far it has been tested against
YARA 3.2.0 on Debian GNU/Linux.
