[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/hillu/go-yara?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/hillu/go-yara)

Go bindings for [YARA](http://plusvic.github.io/yara/), staying as
close as sensible to the library's C-API while taking inspiration from
the `yara-python` implementation.

The current master of YARA after 3.3.0, with read stream support (merged on 2015-02-12) is required.
